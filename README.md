#  Food Recommender CLI

A personalized food and restaurant recommendation system using logistic regression and user history.
You rate dishes you've eaten, and the app learns your preferences to recommend where — and what — you should eat next.

---

##  Features

-  Add and view restaurants with price and cuisine
-  Rate individual dishes with personal score and "Liked" flag
-  Recommender system predicts which restaurants you'll like
-  Suggests up to 3 dishes you've enjoyed in similar cuisines
-  Confidence scoring for every recommendation
-  Datasets saved locally as CSV for full transparency and export

---

##  How It Works

1. You add restaurants to a local CSV file.
2. You rate dishes you’ve tried, including:
   - Dish name
   - Personal rating (1–10)
   - If you liked it (binary)
   - Date visited
3. The model trains on your rating history using `LogisticRegression`.
4. You run recommendations — the top restaurant and matching dishes are shown.
